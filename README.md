============

A fork of [enohka](https://github.com/enohka)'s [modding suite](https://github.com/enohka/moddingSuite) for R.U.S.E, Wargame: European Escalation, Wargame: AirLand Battle, and Wargame: Red Dragon.

The goal is to (hopefully) make modding easier and more consistent by allowing the exporting of game data to spreadsheets and allowing modders to specify updates with SQL or something.

License
============

The Wargame modding suite is released under the MIT license.
